Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for my upcoming college transfer. Due to unforeseen health issues, I am currently unwell and need to take some time to focus on my recovery.

I am confident that with this short break, I will be able to recover fully and resume my academic pursuits without any further complications. I am willing to provide any necessary medical documentation to support my request.

I would like to request a leave of absence from [Date] to [Date] to focus on my recovery. I understand that this may cause some inconvenience, and I apologize for any disruption this may cause.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
