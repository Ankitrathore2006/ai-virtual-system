Here's a song I came up with:

**Title:** "Lost in the Moment"

**Verse 1:**
I find myself in a world outside
Where time stands still and my heart beats wide
I'm chasing sunsets, dancing in the rain
I'm living for the moment, and the moment's in vain

**Chorus:**
I'm lost in the moment, feeling alive
The world is spinning, but I'm standing still inside
I'm free to be me, wild and untamed
I'm lost in the moment, and I'm never the same

**Verse 2:**
I laugh with strangers, cry with friends
I'm writing my own story, till the very end
I'm embracing the unknown, taking the leap
I'm finding my way, and it's all I can keep

**Chorus:**
I'm lost in the moment, feeling alive
The world is spinning, but I'm standing still inside
I'm free to be me, wild and untamed
I'm lost in the moment, and I'm never the same

**Bridge:**
In the stillness, I hear my heart beat
A melody of freedom, a rhythm so sweet
I'm home in the moment, where love resides
I'm lost in the moment, and I'll never step aside

**Chorus:**
I'm lost in the moment, feeling alive
The world is spinning, but I'm standing still inside
I'm free to be me, wild and untamed
I'm lost in the moment, and I'm never the same

**Outro:**
I'll keep on dancing, underneath the stars
I'll keep on singing, from the depths of my scars
I'll keep on living, in this endless sea
I'm lost in the moment, and that's where I'll be.
